# Introduction 介绍

## 0.1 英语词汇学的性质和领域 The Nature and Domain of English Lexicology 

>   Lexicology is a branch of linguistics, inquiring into the origins and meanings of words(WNWD). English lexicology aims at investigating and studying the morphological structures of English words and word equivalents, their semantic structures, relations, historical development, formation and usages.

>   English lexicology is a theoretically-oriented course. It is chiefly concerned with the basic theories of words in general and of English words in particular. However, it is practical course as well, for in the discussion, we shall inevitably deal with copious stocks of words and idioms, and study a great many usage examples. Naturally, there will be a large quantity of practice involved.

>   词汇学是语言学类的一个分支，探究词汇的起源和意义。英语词汇学旨在于研究和学习英语单词和单词等价物的形态结构、语义结构、关系、历史发展、形成以及用法

>   英语词汇学是一门理论导向的课程。它主要关注的是一般词汇的基本理论。同时也是实用的过程，因为在讨论中，我们不可避免地需要处理大量的词语和惯用语，并研究了大量的用例。自然而然的参与了大量的实践。

## 0.2 与其他学科的关系 Its Relation to Other Disciplines 

>   English lexicology itself is a subbranch of linguistics. But it embraces other academic disciplines, such as morphology, semantics, etymology, stylistics, lexicography. Each of them has been established as a discipline in its own right.

>   Morphology is the branch of grammar which studies the structure of forms of words, primarily through the use of morpheme construct. This is one of the major concerns of lexicology, for we shall discuss the inflections of words and word-formation and examine how morphemes are combined to form words and words to form sentences.

>   英语词汇学本身就是语言学科中的一个子分支。但它也融合了其他的学科元素在里面，例如形态学、词源学、语源学、文体学，以及词典编纂学。他们每一个都是作为一门独立的学科而建立的。

>   形态学就是语法的一种分支，语法通过词素结构来研究词形的结构。这也是词汇学研究中的主要内容之一，因为我们将研讨从词形各式各样的变化和构词法，考察词素是如何组合成为单词，单词又如何组合成为句子。

>   Etymology is traditionally used for the study of the origins and history of the form and meaning of words. Modern English is derived from theh languages of early Germanic tribes with a fairly small vocabulary. We shall study how this small vocabulary has grown into a huge modern English vocabulary and explain the changes that have taken place in the forms and meanings of words.

>   Semantics is the study of meanings of different linguistic levels: lexis, syntax, utterance, discourse, etc. But lexicology will focus on the lexical level. The types of meaning and sense relations such as polysemy, homonymy, synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy and semantic field all belong to the scope of semantic study and constitute an important part of lexicology.

>   词源学传统中是用于研究词形、词义的历史和起源。现代英语源于早期日耳曼部落所使用的语言，词汇量很少。我们将研究这样一个小词汇量是如何成长为庞大的现代英语词汇并且解释这些词汇所发生的意义变化和形态变化。

>   语源学是研究不同语言层次的意义：词汇，语法，表达，论述等。但词汇学比较注重于词汇这一层。一词多义、同音异意、同义词、反义词等类型和意识联系以及皆所有属于文体学范围内的语义研究并组成词汇学重要的一部分。

>   Stylistics is the study of style. It is concerned with the user's choices of linguistic elements in a particular context for special effects. Among the areas of study: lexis, phonology, syntax, graphology, we shall concentrate on lexis, exploring the stylistic values of words.

>   Lexicography shares with lexicology the same problems: the form, meaning, origins and usages of words, but they have a pragmatic difference. A lexicographer's task is to record the language as it is used so as to present the genuine picture of words to the reader, providing authoritative reference, where as ther student of lexicology is to acquire the knowledge and information of lexis so as to increase their lexical awareness and capacity of language use.

>   Though English lexicology has a wide coverage of acadermic areas, our task is definite and consistent. That is to study English words in different aspects and from different angles.

>   文体学是对文体上的研究，它关注的是用户在特定语境中对含有特殊影响的语言元素的选择。在词汇学、音韵学、语法学、笔迹学等学科中，我们将重点研究词汇，探讨词汇的文体价值。

>   词典编纂学也表现出和词汇学相同的问题，它的意义、结构、来源和词法，但他们实际上还是有一点差异。词典编撰者的任务是记录当前使用的语言，并将它通过图片文字的形式展现给读者，给那些学习词汇学的学生在获取关于词汇的知识和信息以提高他们的词汇意识和语言运用的能力提供权威参考。

## 0.3 研究的方法论 Methods of Study

>   There are generally two approaches to the study of words, namely synchronic and diachronic. From a synchronic point of view, words can be studied at a point in time, disregarding whatever change might be taking place. For example, the word `wife` now means **a married woman, esp. in relation to her husband**. This is the current meaning. It has an obsolete meaning **woman**, which is only preserved in `midwife`, `housewife`, etc. However, if we take a diachronic perspective, we will consider the word historically, looking into its origin  and changes in form and meaning. In the light, the word `wife` evolved from the Old English form **wif**, meaning `woman`, but later it became specialized in the course of development to the modern meaning **a married woman**. In our linguistic inquiry into the English vocabulary, though our focus is on the synchronic description of words, we need the diachronic approach as a supplement, for a knowledge of historical development of the vocabulary will definitely be of great help to us in our language study.

>   词汇研究一般有两种分析方法，即共时分析法和历时分析法。以共时分析法来看，词汇可以根据某个时间点来研究变化，而不需要考虑将来可能发生的任何变化。例如，“妻子”一词现在意味着“已婚妇女，特别是与丈夫相关的已婚妇女”。这就是当前的意思，它也有一个曾经的意义——女人，这个意义只限于助产人士，家庭主妇等。然而，如果我们以历时分析法的角度来看这个单词，我们会考虑到词汇的历史，查看它的起源或者形式和意义上的变化。在这种方法下，我们发现`wife`这个词是由古英语`wif`演变而来，意为“女人”，但到后来随着不断地细分化后，演变成了现代意义上地“已婚女人”。在我们对英语词汇的词汇学研究中，虽然我们关注的是语义上的共时性描述，但我们也需要历时性的方法作为补充，因为了解词汇的历史发展知识对我们的语言研究毫无疑问会有巨大的帮助。

## 0.4 Aims and Significance of the Course

>   Language study involves the study of speech sounds, grammer and vocabulary. Vocabulary has proved particularly important and certainly the most difficult. In the discussion of the relationship between words and structure, Wilkins(1972) asserts, 'Without grammar very little can be conveyed, without vocabulary nothing can be conveyed.' The lexicologist McCarthy(1990) echoed the same message that no matter how well the student learns grammar, no matter how successfully he masters the sounds of a L2, without words to express a wide range of meanings, communication in that language cannot happen in any meaningful way. The role of vocabulary in communication calls for continuing vocabulary learning. Since English Lexicology deals with English vocabulary, this course will definitely be beneficial.

>   A good konwledge of morphological structure of English words and rules of word-formation will help learners develop their personal vocabulary and consciously increase their word power. The information of the historical development and the principles of classification will give them a deeper understanding of word-meaning and enable them to organize, classify and store words more effectively. The understanding of the semantic structures of words, the types of meaning and their sense relations will gradually raise their awareness of meaning and usages, and enable them to use words more accurately and appropriately. A working knowledge of dictionaries will improve learners' skills of using reference books and raise their word, the study of lexicology will ultimately improve learners' recepetive and productive skills in language processing as well as language production.

>   Language teachers will find lexicology even more helpful. With some knowledge of lexicology, they will be able to handle the teaching materials, particularly those concerning words more professionally. They will be able to select and organize materials to teach in a more effective way. For example, they can teach the rules of word-formation bit by bit and raise the students' awareness of structures of words so as to help them learn new words more quickly and remember better. They will be able to make use of the different sense relations to group vocabulary, interpret words and explain meanings to the students. Their knowledge of dictionaries will prove invaluable in their study and teaching as well. One or two good dictionaries plus skills of use will give a teacher ease, confidence and efficiency.
