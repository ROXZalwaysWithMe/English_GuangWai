## 0.1 英语词汇学的性质和领域 The Nature and Domain of English Lexicology 

>   Lexicology is a branch of linguistics, inquiring into the origins and meanings of words(WNWD). English lexicology aims at investigating and studying the morphological structures of English words and word equivalents, their semantic structures, relations, historical development, formation and usages.

>   English lexicology is a theoretically-oriented course. It is chiefly concerned with the basic theories of words in general and of English words in particular. However, it is practical course as well, for in the discussion, we shall inevitably deal with copious stocks of words and idioms, and study a great many usage examples. Naturally, there will be a large quantity of practice involved.

>   词汇学是语言学类的一个分支，探究词汇的起源和意义。英语词汇学旨在于研究和学习英语单词和单词等价物的形态结构、语义结构、关系、历史发展、形成以及用法

>   英语词汇学是一门理论导向的课程。它主要关注的是一般词汇的基本理论。同时也是实用的过程，因为在讨论中，我们不可避免地需要处理大量的词语和惯用语，并研究了大量的用例。自然而然的参与了大量的实践。

## 0.2 与其他学科的关系 Its Relation to Other Disciplines 

>   English lexicology itself is a subbranch of linguistics. But it embraces other academic disciplines, such as morphology, semantics, etymology, stylistics, lexicography. Each of them has been established as a discipline in its own right.

>   Morphology is the branch of grammar which studies the structure of forms of words, primarily through the use of morpheme construct. This is one of the major concerns of lexicology, for we shall discuss the inflections of words and word-formation and examine how morphemes are combined to form words and words to form sentences.

>   Etymology is traditionally used for the study of the origins and history of the form and meaning of words. Modern English is derived from theh languages of early Germanic tribes with a fairly small vocabulary. We shall study how this small vocabulary has grown into a huge modern English vocabulary and explain the changes that have taken place in the forms and meanings of words.

>   Semantics is the study of meanings of different linguistic levels: lexis, syntax, utterance, discourse, etc. But lexicology will focus on the lexical level. The types of meaning and sense relations such as polysemy, homonymy, synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy and semantic field all belong to the scope of semantic study and constitute an important part of lexicology.

>   Stylistics is the study of style. It is concerned with the user's choices of linguistic elements in a particular context for special effects. Among the areas of study: lexix, phonology, syntax, graphology, we shall concentrate on lexis, exploring the stylistic values of words.

> Lexicography shares with lexicology the same problems: the form, meaning, origins and usages of words, but they have a pragmatic difference. A lexicographer's task is to record the language as it is used so as to present the genuine picture of words to the reader, providing authoritative reference, where as ther student of lexicology is to acquire the knowledge and information of lexis so as to increase their lexical awareness and capacity of language use.

> Though English lexicology has a wide coverage of acadermic areas, our task is definite and consistent. That is to study English words in different aspects and from different angles.
