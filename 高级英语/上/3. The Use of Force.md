They were new patients to me, all I had was the name, Olson. Please come down as soon as you can, my daughter is very sick.

> 他们是我的新病人，而我所知道的只有名字 Olosn. 请尽快过来，我女儿现在非常不舒服。

When I arrived I was met by the mother, a big startled looking woman, very clean and apologetic who merely said, Is this the doctor? And let me in. In the back, she added. You must excuse us, doctor, we have her in the kitchen where it is warm. It is very damp here sometimes.

> 当我抵达的时候先见到了一个母亲，一个看起来受了惊吓的大个子女人，身上非常干净同时满怀歉意地说，你就是医生吗？然后就让我进去。在背后她说道。请原谅我们，医生，我们把她放在了厨房，那里比较温暖。这里有时非常潮湿。

The child was fully dressed and sitting on her father's lap near the kitchen table. He tried to get up, but I motioned for him not to bother, took off my overcoat and started to look things over. I could see that they were all very nervous, eyeing me up and down distrustfully. As often, in such cases, they weren't telling me more than they had to, it was up to me to tell them; that's why they were spending three dollars on me.

> 在厨房的桌子边上，孩子衣衫整齐躺在她父亲的大腿上。他尝试着起来，我摆摆手让他不必麻烦了，之后脱下我的外衣开始准备检查。我可以看到他们都非常的紧张，抱有怀疑地上下打量着我。通常，类似于这种情况，他们都不会主动告诉我多少东西，反过来需要我告诉他们；这就是为什么他们花了三美元请我来。

The child was fairly eating me up with her cold, steady eyes, and no expression on her face whatever. She did not move and seemed, inwardly, quiet; an usually attractive little thing, and as strong as a heifer in appearance. But her face was flushed, she was breathing rapidly, and I realized that she had a high fever. She had magnificent blonde hair, in profusion. One of those picture children often reproduced in advertising leaflets and the photogravure sections of the Sunday papers.

> 孩子的眼神一直冷冷的看着我，简直就像要把我吃掉一样，同时无论怎样她都面无表情。她纹丝不动，而且看起来内心似乎很平静；真是个惹人喜欢的小东西，而且外表结实得像一只小母牛。但她的脸颊红彤彤的，呼吸痕迹，我意识到她正在发高烧。她留着高贵的金色长发，非常浓密。就像经常登印在广告传单或者周末报纸的照片栏里的那些孩子一样。

She's had a fever for three days, began the father and we don't know what it comes from. My wife has given her things, you know, like people do, but it don't do no good. And there's been a lot of sickness around. So we tho't you'd better look her over and tell us what is the matter.

> 她已经发烧了三天了，他父亲开口说道，我们不知道是什么病。我妻子曾尝试过让她吃一些东西，你知道的，跟平时人们做的一样，但并没有好转。这里附近也有很多疾病。所以我们希望你最好看看她并告诉我们这到底发生了什么。

As doctors often do I took a trial shot at it as a point of departure. Has she had a sore throat?

> 我跟平常医生一样先从一个点出发试试看，她喉咙痛吗？

Both parents answered me together, No...No, she says her throat don't hurt her.

> 不不不，她父母同时回答我，她说她的喉咙没有伤害她

Does your throat hurt you? Added the mother to the child. But the little girl's expression didn't change nor did she move her eyes from my face.

> 你的喉咙有在伤害你吗？随后母亲问向孩子。但这个小女孩的表情并未改变同时也没有将她的目光从我的脸上移开。

Have you looked?

> 你看见了吗？

I tried to, said the mother, but I couldn't see.

> 她母亲说完，我尝试了一下，但我没法看见。

As it happens we had been having a number of cases of diphtheria in the school to which this child went during that month and we were all, quite apparently, thinking of that, though no one had as yet spoken of the thing.

> 在这个孩子上课的学校里，我们这个月发现了好几个白喉症状的学生，很显然，我们都在思考这件事情，即使没有人说起过。

Well, I said, suppose we take a look at the throat first. I smiled in my best professional manner and asking for the child's first name I said, come on, Mathilda, open your mouth and let's take a look at your throat.

> 好的，我说着，我想我们首先需要看一看喉咙。我笑着并带着最专业的专家态度念着孩子的名字，我说来吧 Mathilda，张开嘴让我看一下你的喉咙。

Nothing doing.

> 她没有任何反应。

Aw, come on, I coaxed, just open your mouth wide and let me take a look. Look, I said opening both hands wide, I haven't anything in my lands. Just open up and let me see.

> 噢，来吧，我劝诱着她，只要张大你的嘴巴让我看一眼就可以了。看，我说着同时也把手摊开，我的手里没有东西，就张嘴让我看看就行了。

Such a nice man, put in the mother. Look how kind he is to you. Come on, do what he tells you to. He won't hurt you.

> 真是个好人，她母亲说着。看他对你多么善良，来呀，照他说的来做。他不会伤害你的。

At that I ground my teeth in disgust. If only they wouldn't use the word "hurt" I might be able to get somewhere. But I did not allow myself to be hurried or disturbed but speaking quietly and slowly I approached the child again.

> 听到这时我不由得厌恶地咬了咬牙。如果他们不用“伤害”这个词我可能已经有所进展。但我控制自己不能着急或者被打乱，而是轻声细语地再次靠近这个孩子。

As I moved my chair a little nearer suddenly with one catlike movement both her hands clawed instinctively for my eyes and she almost reached them too. In fact she knocked my glasses flying and they fell, though unbroken, several feet away from me on the kitchen floor.

> 当我把我的椅子挪近了一点之后突然她的手像猫一样本能地抓向我的眼睛，挤进就要戳到。但实际上她戳到了我的眼镜并弹飞了它，眼镜跌落到地上，虽然没摔碎，但也飞了好几步远的距离。

Both the mother and father almost turned themselves inside out in embarrassment and apology. You bad girl, said the mother, taking her and shaking her by one arm. Look what you've done. The nice man...

> 她的父母马上陷入尴尬和抱歉。你这个坏女孩，她母亲说道并拿着她的一只手摇晃起来。看你干的好事，这个好人…

For heaven's sake, I broke in. Don't call me a nice man to her. I'm here to look at her throat on the chance that she might have diphtheria and possibly die of it. But that's nothing to her. Look here, I said to the child, we're going to look at your throat. You're old enough to understand what I'm saying. Will you open it now by yourself or shall we have to open it for you?

> 我马上打断了她，在她面前不要再称呼我为好人了。我来这里是抱着希望为了检查她的喉咙，否则她可能得了白喉并可能因此而死。但她依然无动于衷。看，我对孩子说，我们来这里就是为了检查你的喉咙。你已经长大了能听懂我在说什么的对吗。你可以现在自己张开嘴或者我们来帮助你张开？

Not a move. Even her expression hadn't changed. Her breaths, however, were coming faster and faster. Then the battle began. I had to do it. I had to have a throat culture for her own protection. But first I told the parents that it was entirely up to them. I explained the danger but said that I would not insist on a throat examination so long as they would take the responsibility.

> 她没动弹，即使她的表情没有改变，然而她的呼吸变得越来越快。然后我们的对决便开始了。我必须做到。为了她的身体，我必须对她做喉咙细菌检查。但首先我必须要把这些完完全全地告诉她的父母，我想他们解释了这个病的危险但我说如果你们愿意承担后果，我不会坚持做喉咙测试。

If you don't do what the doctor says you'll have to go to the hospital, the mother admonished her severely.

> 如果你不按医生说的做的话你就必须要去医院，她母亲严肃地劝告她。

Oh yeah? I had to smile to myself. After all, I had already fallen in love with the savage brat, the parents were contemptible to me. In the ensuing struggle they grew more and more abject, crushed, exhausted while she surely rose to magnificent heights of insane fury of effort bred of her terror of me.

> 可以了吧? 我还是要保持微笑。在准备好后，我像跟这个凶猛的小不点相爱一般，她父母甚至有点鄙视我。在随后发生的争斗中，她对我的恐惧引起她疯狂的愤怒上升到惊人的高度。他们也变得越来越卑下，然后崩溃，最后疲惫不堪。

The father tried his best, and he was a big man but the fact that she was his daughter, his shame at her behavior and his dread of hurting her made him release her just at the critical times when I had almost achieved success, till I wanted to kill him. But his dread also that she might have diphtheria made him tell me to go on, go on though he himself was almost fainting, while the mother moved back and forth behind use raising and lowering her hands in an agony of apprehension.

> 她父亲用尽了所有努力，他既是个强壮的男人，但她也是他的亲生女儿，他为女儿的行为感到羞愧同时也害怕自己伤害到她，就在我就要成功这危急时刻，他放开了她，那时我连杀他的心都有了。不过同时他也害怕女儿得了白喉病便告诉我再来，接着虽然他自己都几近昏厥了，她母亲在她身后踱来踱去，她的手也在忧虑的恐惧中抖上抖下。

Put her in front of you on your lap, I ordered, and hold both her wrists.

> 把她放到你前面来，坐在你腿上，我吩咐着，同时握着她的手腕。

But as soon as he did the child let out a scream. Don't, you're hurting me. Let go of my hands. Let them go I tell you. Then she shrieked terrifyingly, hysterically. Stop it! Stop it! You're killing me!

> 但很快他的做法让孩子尖叫了一声。不要，你在伤害我。放开我的双手，让他们走我告诉你。然后她痛苦地尖叫起来，歇斯底里地，停下来！停下来！你想杀了我！

Do you think she can stand it, doctor! Said the mother.

> 你觉得她能受得了吗，医生！她母亲说道。

You get out, said the husband to his wife. Do you want her to die of diphtheria?

> 你走开，她丈夫对她说着。你想让她死在白喉病下吗？

Come on now, hold her, I said.

> 现在来吧，控制住她，我说道。

Then I grasped the child's head with my left hand and tried to get the wooden tongue depressor between her teeth. She fought, with clenched teeth, desperately! But now I also had grown furious——at a child. I tried
to hold myself down but I couldn't. I know how to expose a throat for inspection. And I did my best. When finally I got the wooden spatula behind the last teeth and just the point of it into the mouth cavity, she opened up for an instant but before I could see anything she came down again and gripped the wooden blade between her molars. She reduced it to splinters before I could get it out again.

> 接着我用左手按住孩子的头病尝试将木制的压舌板伸进她的牙齿之间。她反抗着，非常绝望地闭紧了她的牙齿！但我现在也有点愤怒了——对一个孩子。我尝试冷静下来但我没办法。我知道如何让喉咙露出来检查。我也尽了我所有的努力。当到了最后我终于把木制的压舌板伸进到她的最后一颗牙齿后面，马上就要到嘴洞里的时候，她瞬间张开但在我能看见任何东西之前马上用她的臼齿紧紧咬住木片。我甚至还没来得及将木片抽出，她已经咬碎了。

Aren't you ashamed, the mother yelled at her. Aren't you ashamed to act like that infront of the doctor?

> 你不感到羞耻吗，她母亲对她大叫着。你在医生面前这样做不感到羞耻吗？

Get me a smooth-handled spoon of some sort, I told the mother. We're going through with this. The child's mouth was already bleeding. Her tongue was cut and she was screaming in wild hysterical shrieks. Perhaps I should have desisted and come back in an hour or more. No doubt it would have been better. But I have seen at least two children lying dead in bed of neglect in such cases, and feeling that I must get a diagnosis now or never I went at it again. But the worst of it was that I too had got beyond reason. I could have torn the child apart in my own fury and enjoyed it. It was a pleasure to attack her. My face was burning with it.

> 帮我拿一个平柄的勺子什么的来，我跟她母亲说。我们要坚持到底。孩子的嘴里已经出血。她的舌头由于被割到了，她歇斯底里地狂叫起来。或许应该暂时停止之后等上一个多小时再来。毫无疑问这样更好一点。但我曾经目睹了至少两个孩子躺在床上，在无人看管下最终迎来了死亡，我感觉到我必须现在就开始诊断不应该等到下一次了。但最糟糕的是我也一样失去了理智。我曾在愤怒中想到要将这孩子撕成碎片并享受这个过程。想着攻击她是一种乐趣。我为此感到了脸红羞愧。

The damned little brat must be protected against her own idiocy, one says to one's self at such times. Others must be protected against her. It is a social necessity. And all these things are true. But a blind fury, a feeling of adult shame, bred of a longing for muscular release are the operatives. One goes on to the end.

> 这个该死的小鬼头，我必须要保护她以免她被自己愚蠢的行为害死，我对自己说了好几遍。也必须保护她的其他安全。这是我在这个社会需要做的。这些都是对的。盲目的愤怒也好，成年人的羞愧也好，肌肉力量释放的天生反应才是最后起作用的因素。自始至终都是。

In the final unreasoning assault I overpowered the child's neck and jaws. I forced the heavy silver spoon back of her teeth and down her throat till she gagged. And there it was——both tonsils covered with membrane She had fought valiantly to keep me from knowing her secret. She had been hiding that sore throat for three days at least and lying to her paretns in order to escape just such an outcome as this.

> 最后在我蛮横无理地攻击下，我压制住了孩子的脖子和下巴。我强行将这把沉重的银勺伸入到她的牙齿后并压住上咽，直到她产生作呕反应。在那里我看到了扁桃体都覆盖上了一层膜状物，她为了防止我知道她的秘密发起了英勇地抵抗。她已经隐藏了三天她喉咙痛的事情并欺骗了她父母，就为了避免遇到看医生这样的事情。

Now truly she was furious. She had been on the defensive before but now she attacked. Tried to get off her father's lap and fly at me while tears of defeat blinded her eyes.

> 现在她真的恼怒了。她之前一直都被迫防御着，但现在她要主动进攻了。尝试着脱离她父亲的大腿并向我飞来，那眼角因为被打败而流出的眼泪朦胧了她的眼睛。
