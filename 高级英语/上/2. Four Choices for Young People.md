# Four Choices for Young People:

## Text

Shortly before his graduation, Jim Binns, president of the senior class at Stanford University, wrote me about some of his misgivings. "More than any other generation," he said, "our generation views the adult world with great skepticism...there is also an increased tendency to reject completely that world."

> 在他毕业之前不久，Jim Binns，也是他们斯坦福大学毕业班的班长，写给我关于他的一些担忧。“比起其他任何一代人来说，” 他说道，“我们这一代都更加怀疑成人世界...甚至有一种更强烈的趋势想要完全拒绝这个世界。”

Apparently he speaks for a lot of his contemporaries. During the last few years, I have listened to scores of young people, in college and out, who were just as nervous about the grown-up world. Roughly, their attitude might be summed up about like this: "The world is in pretty much of a mess, full of injustice, poverty and war. The people responsible are, presumably, the adults who have been running things. If they can't do better than that, what have they got to teach our generation? That kind of lesson we can do without."

> 显然的，他代表了很多他的同龄人。在过去的几年里，我听过许多年轻人无论是大学里的还是学校外面的，他们都对成长后的世界感到紧张。粗略地说，他们的态度可以被总结为：“这个世界正出现大量的混乱，充满了不公、贫困和战争。而要为此负责的，大概就是当前正在统治世界的成年人们。如果他们无法做得更好，那他们还能教育我们这一代人什么呢？这样的教育我们不受也罢。”

These conclusions strike me as reasonable, at least from their point of view. The relevant question for the arriving generation is not whether our society is imperfect(we can take that for granted), but how to deal with it. For all its harshness and irrationality, it is the only world we've got. Choosing a strategy to cope with it, then, is the first decision young adults have to make, and usually the most important decision of their lifetime. So far as I have been able to discover, there are only four basic alternatives:

> 诸如此类的结论冲击着我，但至少在他们的角度看来也是合理的。对于即将到来的一代人来说，关键问题不是在于我们的社会是否不完美（这也是理所当然的），而是在于我们应该如何面对它。尽管它是如此的残酷且不合理，那也是我们所拥有的唯一的世界。选择策略去应对它是年轻人必须做出的第一个决定，通常也是他们人生中最重要的一个决定。据我所知，目前只有四种基本选择：

I. Drop out
This is one of the oldest expedients, and it can be practised anywhere, at any age, and with or without the use of hallucinogens. It always has been the strategy of choice for people who find the world too brutal or too complex to be endured. By definition, this way of life is parasitic. In one way or another, its practitioners batten on the society which they scorn and in which they refuse to take any responsibility. Some of us find this distasteful--an undignified kind of life. But for the poor in spirit, with low levels of both energy and pride, it may be the least intolerable choice available.

> 一，放弃
> 这是最古老的权宜之计之一，他可以在任何地点、任何年龄使用、也不需要使用致幻剂麻醉自己。对于那些感觉到世界太残酷也太复杂的人们来说，这一直是他们的首选策略。根据定义，这样的生活方式是寄生性的。选择这条路的人总是以各种方式苟存于他们所蔑视的社会中，同时他们拒绝承担任何责任。我们中的部分人认为这种生活令人厌恶--是一种不体面的生活。但对于那些精神贫瘠、精力不足、自尊心不强的人而言，这可能是他们不需要忍受的。

II. Flee
This strategy also has ancient antecedents. Ever since civilization began, certain individuals have tried to run away from it in hopes of finding a simpler, more pastoral, and more peaceful life. Unlike the dropouts, they are not parasites. They are willing to support themselves and to contribute something to the general community, but they simply don't like the environment of civilization; that is, the city, with all its ugliness and tension.

The trouble with this solution is that it no longer is practical on a large scale. Our planet, unfortunately, is running out of noble savages and unsullied landscapes; except for the polar regions, the frontiers are gone. A few gentleman farmers with plenty of money can still escape to the bucolic life--but in general the stream of migration is flowing the other way.

> 二，逃离
> 这种策略也有着悠久的渊源。自从文明诞生之始，一直有部分人尝试着逃离文明，希望找到更简单、更朴素、更加和平的生活。与那些放弃的人不同，他们并不是寄生虫。他们愿意自给自足甚至贡献点什么给到群体，但他们就是不喜欢文明的环境；那就是，城市，一个充满了丑陋和拥挤的地方。
>
> 这种解决方案的问题在于，它已经无法在大范围使用。我们的星球，很不幸运，它已经没有崇高的野人和纯净的土地了；除了极地地区，已经没有了边界。只有少数拥有大量财富的绅士农夫可以一直生活于农田之间，但总体上，人口迁移的趋势是朝着相反的方向发展。

III. Plot a Revolution
This strategy is always popular among those who have no patience with the tedious workings of the democratic process or who believe that basic institutions can only be changed by force. It attracts some of the more active and idealistic young people of every generation. To them it offers a romantic appeal, usually symbolized by some dashing and charismatic figure.

It has the event greater appeal of simplicity: "Since this society is hopelessly bad, let's smash it and build something better on the ruins."

> 三，策划一场革命
> 这种策略对于那些对乏味的民主进程没有耐心或者是觉得基本体制只有通过武力才能改变的人来说总是很受欢迎。它受到每一代更积极、更有理想的年轻人的青睐。对于他们来说，它具有浪漫的吸引力，通常体现在一些潇洒、有魅力的人物身上。

> 它还有更令人吸引的一点在于它足够的简单：“既然这个社会已经到了无药可救的地步，那就让我们一起粉碎它，在废墟上重建新的家园。”

Some of my best friends have been revolutionists, and a few of them have led reasonably satisfying lives. These are the ones whose revolutions did not come off; they have been able to keep on cheerfully plotting their holocausts right into their senescence.
Others died young, in prison or on the barricades. But the most unfortunate are those whose revolutions have succeeded. They lived, in bitter disillusionment, to see the establishment they had overthrown replaced by a new one, just as hard-faced and stuffy.

> 我一些最好的朋友曾是革命者，他们中的少数人过着还算满意的生活。这些人的革命并未得手；他们能够一直欢快的策划着他们的大屠杀直到老去。还有一些人英年早逝，死在监狱里或者街垒之上。但最不幸的是那些革命成功的人，他们存活下来，却在痛苦之后幻灭，他们看着被他们推翻的政权被一个新的政权取代，但新的政权却同样面目狰狞、闷闷不乐。

I am not, of course, suggesting that revolutions accomplish nothing. Some (the American Revolution, the French Revolution) clearly do change things for the better. My point is merely that the idealists who make the revolution are bound to be disappointed in either case. For at best their victory never dawns on the shining new world they had dreamed of, cleansed of all human meanness. Instead it dawns on a familiar, workaday place, still in need of groceries and sewage disposal. The revolutionary state, under whatever political label, has to be run--not by violent romantics--but by experts in marketing, sanitary engineering, and the management of bureaucracies.

> 我不是，当然，这不能意味着革命总是一无所成。一些革命（美国革命、法国革命）都显而易见地改变事物朝更好的方向发展，我的观点仅仅只是无论什么情况下，太理想化的革命者往往最终都会面临失望。即使是最好的情况下，他们的胜利也永远不会映照在那个他们梦寐以求的闪耀的新世界，那个驱逐了所有人性阴暗的世界。取而代之的仍是那个熟悉的、日常的地方，
